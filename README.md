# Cloud Operating System Research Paper

Areas explored in the research paper include:

*Cloud OS hypervisors that operate on top of hardware and control the virtual machine
*The additional provisions of cloud operating systems above and beyond providing the traditional OS functionality, such as managing security, the network, the VM life cycle and images, and computing and storage capacity
*How cloud OSs act as host OSs while functioning concurrently with subordinate guest OSs
*Cloud OS security concerns such as phishing attacks against browser-led OSs that run TLS, XML wrapper attacks, kernel attacking malware, DDOS attacks
*Cloud OS security measures such as Hypersafe systems that lock down write-protected areas of memory, VM checkpoints, Malware that requires authentication signatures and repeatedly checks page table integrity
